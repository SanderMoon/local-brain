brain-review - AI Project Analysis

⚠ This feature is not yet implemented.

Future functionality:
  - Analyze project notes and todos
  - Generate project summaries
  - Suggest next actions
  - Create .context.md files for AI agents

Planned integration:
  - LLM CLI tools (e.g., `llm`, `aichat`, `gpt`)
  - Auto-generate context summaries
  - Support for Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Implementation ideas:
  1. Read notes.md and todo.md from current project
  2. Pipe content to LLM with structured prompt
  3. Display analysis and suggestions
  4. Optionally update .context.md file

To implement:
  - Install LLM CLI: pip install llm (https://github.com/simonw/llm)
  - Edit this script to pipe project data to LLM
  - Example: cat notes.md todo.md | llm "Analyze this project and suggest priorities"

Current workaround:
  - Manually copy notes/tasks to your AI assistant
  - Use MCP filesystem server to give AI access to ~/brain
